# Protohackers
 
[Protohackers](https://protohackers.com) is a programming challenge website, in the style of Advent of Code, but centred around network programming
instead of generic programming challenges. It's a great little set of challenges to either train new people how to write
networking code, keep your skills sharp if you don't write networking code all that often or if you want to learn how to
write networking code in a new language

## Smoke Test
[Smoke Test](./smoke_test) is a challenge that simply requires one to write a TCP echo server (noting that it must be
able to handle binary files).
